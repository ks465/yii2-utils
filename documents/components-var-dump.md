##VarDump Class
This is a third party class offering dumping variables with ability to expand or hide parts of data. 
In this way it can keep the display clear.
The original class has multiple themes included, which are named after comic strip heroes. 
They are kept the same to avoid changing the code very much.
  
_**Because this is a third party class, there is no unit test for this class.** For examples see the demo section._

_**There is no need to call methods in this class directly. Just use `vd` or `vdd` as following examples show.**_

1. `vd` Dump one _or more_ variables and continue execution.
1. `vdd` Dump one *or more* variables. This method will stop your script after the dump.
